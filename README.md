# Java Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate Java projects that I developed to practice and enhance my programming skills. Each project is self-contained, with clear instructions, source code, and documentation. These projects demonstrate various Java concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), file I/O, exception handling, and user interaction.

## Projects List
Hereâ€™s a list of the projects included in this repository, along with a brief description of each:

1. **[Calculator](01-Calculator/)**
   - A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with error handling for invalid inputs.

2. **[Number Guessing Game](02-Number-Guessing-Game/)**
   - A command-line game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user guesses it with hints like "too high" or "too low."

3. **[Unit Converter](03-Unit-Converter/)**
   - A program that converts between different units of measurement, such as kilometers to miles, Celsius to Fahrenheit, and more.

4. **[Password Generator](04-Password-Generator/)**
   - A secure password generator that allows users to specify length and character requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

5. **[Word Counter](05-Word-Counter/)**
   - A program that reads a text file and counts the number of words, characters, and lines, showcasing file I/O and basic text analysis.

6. **[To-Do List](06-To-Do-List/)**
   - A task management application where users can add, view, remove, and mark tasks as complete.

7. **[Simple Quiz](07-Simple-Quiz/)**
   - A multiple-choice quiz application that tracks the user's score and provides feedback for each question.

8. **[Contact Book](08-Contact-Book/)**
   - A command-line application to manage contacts (add, view, edit, delete), using object-oriented programming concepts.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for all projects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used extensively in projects like Contact Book and To-Do List.
- **File I/O**: Implemented in projects like Word Counter for reading and writing files.
- **Data Structures**: Lists and arrays used in projects like To-Do List and Simple Quiz.
