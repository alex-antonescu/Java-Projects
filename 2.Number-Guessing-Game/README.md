# Number Guessing Game

## Description
A fun and interactive command-line game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user must guess it. The program provides feedback such as "too high" or "too low" to help the user reach the correct answer. This project demonstrates the use of loops, random number generation, and conditional statements in Java.

## Features
- Generates a random number within a user-defined range.
- Provides hints to the user:
  - "Too high" if the guess is greater than the target number.
  - "Too low" if the guess is less than the target number.
- Tracks the number of attempts made by the user.
- Ends the game when the correct number is guessed.

## How to Run
